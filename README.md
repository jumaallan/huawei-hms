> I have committed the google-services json file, but should be replaced with one generated on your side


### Background

Develop a demo app, using the Huawei Map Kit and Location Kit SDK:

* When the user opens the app, it should locate the user's current location and show on the Huawei Map.
* Mark the user's current location on the Map with a star/marker, and pop up the user's current address when they click the star/marker - show the address description not the Geocoding value. 
* User can move and click on the map, and the marker will move to the point as the user clicks - popup the address description when the user pins a point on the map.
